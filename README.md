Welcome to Numerics-Enhanced, a portable class library replete with algorithms and utilities geared towards machine learning, mathematics, finance, and numerical methods. Being a PCL, it can be used not only in any .Net project but also for iOS or Mac development via Xamarin. The library has been improved and enhanced by lolocake, gaining from the original inspiration by Orbifold's consultancy where it was developed over many years in a variety of domains and businesses. Some parts of the library have been ported to Swift (native iOS), further opening possibilities for various development projects. For more detailed documentation and specifics of the library, head on over to the project's wiki pages.
